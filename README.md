# Todo Project

The bussiness has come up with a game-changing idea; one that will surely propel us to the stratosphere.
The idea is an app that allows you to list items that need to be done, and check them off as they are completed; pretty revolutionary, huh?

Within this repository you will find [backend](./backend) and [frontend](./frontend) projects.

The **backend** is a simple Node HTTP API that allows for managing the todo content.

The **frontend** is a beautiful HTML web UI, which provides a human interface to the backend API; allowing people to manage their todos.

The business wants to get this off the ground ASAP! Here's what they are after:

* The app is to be hosted in AWS
* We expect a quick uptake in users from all around the world, obviously, so it will need to scale to support those users
* There are plans to add new features, so there should be a process in place to deliver updates to both the backend and frontend
* We move fast here! So we need to know if things go wrong

## Instructions

The tools and technologies you use are totally up to you, the only requirements are listed above, as well as any information you might take from the job posting.

At a bare minimum, you should submit documentation which details your solution and how you would implement it; however you may also choose to implement your solution within this repository.
